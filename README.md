# downloaderpy
## Description: This is a Python2 script which downloads files from the links stored in a text-file.

## Why did I build this?
* I wanted to download all free Microsoft e-books from a list of URLs present in a text file. 
* This script automates the process and helps you save time by automating the process instead of opening individual download links

## How is it useful to you?
* You can use it to download anything you want from the web if you have a list of URLs in a text file. Just use this file and modify the source text file name

### P. S. This script can also handle errors and will skip broken URLs
